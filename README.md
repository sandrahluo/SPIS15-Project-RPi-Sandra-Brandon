# SPIS15-Project-RPi-Sandra-Brandon
Raspberry Pi code for Sandra Luo and Brandon Tran's project
Our idea for our project is either a robot that starts to dance whenever it hears music and it would dance faster or slower depending on the tempo of the music or to have the robot use its sensors to sense the color red and move towards it similar to how a bull becomes enraged by the color red.
